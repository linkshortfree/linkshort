# The Ultimate Guide to Sharing Links on Social Media (2026 Edition)

Social media platforms want one thing: to keep users on their app. This makes sharing external links tricky. Algorithms often downrank posts that send users away. However, with the right strategy, you can still drive massive traffic.

## 1. Instagram: The "Link in Bio" Strategy

Instagram posts still don't allow clickable links in captions.
*   **Stories:** Use the "Link Sticker". Make it visually appealing.
*   **Bio:** Use a single, clean short link (like `linkshort.live/bio`) that redirects to a landing page or your latest offer.

## 2. LinkedIn: The "First Comment" Myth

For years, people put links in the first comment to avoid ranking penalties. In 2026, LinkedIn's algorithm has evolved. 
*   **Current Best Practice:** Include the link in the post but focus on **rich preview metadata**. Ensure your destination URL has a great Open Graph (OG) image. A short link usually preserves these previews if the redirect is fast (which LinkShort's are).

## 3. TikTok & Shorts

Short-form video is dominant. 
*   **QR Codes:** This is the killer feature. Flash a branded QR code at the end of your video. Users can screenshot it and scan it later.
*   **Verbal CTAs:** "Link in bio" is still king. Make your alias memorable (e.g., `linkshort.live/deal`) so users can type it if they have to.

## 4. Avoiding "Spam" Flags

Using generic, public shorteners can sometimes get you flagged as spam because bad actors use them too.
*   **Solution:** Use LinkShort's **Custom Alias** feature. Algorithms trust `linkshort.live/my-brand-name` much more than `linkshort.live/3f8a1b`.

## Summary
Social media is a rented audience. Your goal should always be to move them to your owned channels (website, email list). Smart link usage is the bridge to make that happen.
