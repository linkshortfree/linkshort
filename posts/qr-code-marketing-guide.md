# Ultimate Guide to QR Code Marketing in 2026

QR codes are no longer just for restaurant menus. In 2026, they are the bridge between your physical assets and your digital ecosystem.

## Why QR Codes?
1. **Instant Access**: No more typing long URLs.
2. **Measurable**: Track every scan with UTM parameters.
3. **Versatile**: Use them on business cards, packaging, and billboards.

## Best Practices
- **Contrast is Key**: Ensure your QR code is dark on a light background.
- **Size Matters**: Don't make it too small to scan.
- **Clear CTA**: Tell users why they should scan (e.g., "Scan for 20% off").
