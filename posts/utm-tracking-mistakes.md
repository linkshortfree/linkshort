# 5 Mistakes to Avoid in UTM Tracking

Accurate attribution is the holy grail of digital marketing. Yet, many teams struggle with messy UTM data. Here’s how to fix it.

## 1. Inconsistent Naming
"Email", "email", and "Newsletter" are three different mediums in GA4. Pick one and stick to it.

## 2. Using UTMs for Internal Links
Never use UTM parameters for links *inside* your own website. This resets the session and breaks your attribution.

## 3. Forgetting the Source
Every UTM link must have at least a `utm_source` and `utm_medium`.

## 4. Too Many Parameters
Keep it simple. Don't use `utm_term` and `utm_content` unless you're actually A/B testing or running search ads.

## 5. Manual Building Errors
Typos can kill your data. Use a tool like the **LinkShort UTM Builder** to ensure your links are perfectly formatted every time.
